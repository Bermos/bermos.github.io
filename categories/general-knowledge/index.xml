For reference, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the defaults given by the RaspberryPi camera module. If any kind of detail of movement should be captured the length between taking single pictures cannot be too great. For active scenes with people moving about a picture once every minute won&amp;rsquo;t cut it. One every 5 seconds is from my personal testing about right to capture human scale movement.</description></item></channel></rss>
