Between growing up as a huge Star Trek fan and my mother doing her web publishing certifications my first foray into all
thing IT began with me trying to make a website showcasing the many spaceships in Star Trek in a LCARS inspired presentation.

Shortly after that I began to dream big and had set my mind that I wanted to programm a video game.
So the next time my mom and I went to a book store I started looking and found what I needed.
“Spieleprogrammieren mit C++”, or programming games with C++.
It might not have been the best introduction to programming for a 12-year-old but at that age how should I have known?
I got stuck somewhere after pointers were introduced, but I was far enough that I could programm simple CLI and that made me pretty happy.

After high school I was considering to study the trombone, which had been the focus over the last few years but the job
prospects made me reevaluate that idea. So now I am finishing my bachelors in computer science while working part-time as a DevOps engineer.
